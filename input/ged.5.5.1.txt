~LINEAGE_LINKED_GEDCOM:=
//This is a model of the lineage-linked GEDCOM structure for submitting data to other lineage-linked
//GEDCOM processing systems. A header and a trailer record are required, and they can enclose any
//number of data records. Tags from Appendix A (see page 83) must be used in the same context as
//shown in the following form. User defined tags (see <NEW_TAG> on page 56) are discouraged but
//when used must begin with an under-score. Tags that are required within a desired context have been
//bolded. Note that some contexts are not required but if they are used then the bolded tags are
//required.

//* NOTE:
//Submissions to the Family History Department for Ancestral File submission or for clearing temple ordinances must use a
//DESTination of ANSTFILE or TempleReady, respectively.
//The header structure provides information about the entire transmission. The SOURce system name
//identifies which system sent the data. The DESTination system name identifies the intended receiving
//system.
//Additional GEDCOM standards will be produced in the future to reflect GEDCOM expansion and
//maturity. This requires the reading program to make sure it can read the GEDC.VERS and the
//GEDC.FORM values to insure proper readability. The CHAR tag is required. All character codes
//greater than 0x7F must be converted to ANSEL. (See Chapter 3, starting on page 77.)

//The FAMily record is used to record marriages, common law marriages, and family unions caused by
//two people becoming the parents of a child. There can be no more than one HUSB/father and one
//WIFE/mother listed in each FAM_RECORD. If, for example, a man participated in more than one
//family union, then he would appear in more than one FAM_RECORD. The family record structure

//The preferred order of the CHILdren pointers within a FAMily structure is chronological by birth.

//The individual record is a compilation of facts, known or discovered, about an individual. Sometimes
//these facts are from different sources. This form allows documentation of the source where each of
//the facts were discovered.
//The normal lineage links are shown through the use of pointers from the individual to a family
//through either the FAMC tag or the FAMS tag. The FAMC tag provides a pointer to a family where
//this person is a child. The FAMS tag provides a pointer to a family where this person is a spouse or
//parent. The <<CHILD_TO_FAMILY_LINK>> (see page 31) structure contains a FAMC pointer
//which is required to show any child to parent linkage for pedigree navigation. The
//<<CHILD_TO_FAMILY_LINK>> structure also indicates whether the pedigree link represents a
//birth lineage, an adoption lineage, or a sealing lineage.
//Linkage between a child and the family they belonged to at the time of an event can also be shown
//by a FAMC pointer subordinate to the appropriate event. For example, a FAMC pointer subordinate
//to an adoption event indicates a relationship to family by adoption. Biological parents can be shown
//by a FAMC pointer subordinate to the birth event(optional).
//Other associations or relationships are represented by the ASSOciation tag. The person's relation
//or association is the person being pointed to. The association or relationship is stated by the value
//on the subordinate RELA line. For example:
//0 @I1@ INDI
//1 NAME Fred/Jones/
//1 ASSO @I2@

//As a general rule, events are things that happen on a specific date. Use the date form ‘BET date
//AND date’ to indicate that an event took place at some time between two dates. Resist the
//temptation to use a ‘FROM date TO date’ form in an event structure. If the subject of your
//recording occurred over a period of time, then it is probably not an event, but rather an attribute or
//fact.
//The EVEN tag in this structure is for recording general events that are not shown in the above
//<<INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_STRUCTURE>>. The event indicated by this general EVEN tag is
//defined by the value of the subordinate TYPE tag. For example, a person that signed a lease for land
//dated October 2, 1837 and a lease for equipment dated November 4, 1837 would be written in
//GEDCOM as::
//1 EVEN
//2 TYPE Land Lease
//2 DATE 2 OCT 1837
//1 EVEN
//2 TYPE Equipment Lease
//2 DATE 4 NOV 1837
//The TYPE tag can be optionally used to modify the basic understanding of its superior event or
//attribute. For example:
//1 GRAD
//2 TYPE College
//The occurrence of an event is asserted by the presence of either a DATE tag and value or a PLACe
//tag and value in the event structure. When neither the date value nor the place value are known then
//a Y(es) value on the parent event tag line is required to assert that the event happened. For example
//each of the following GEDCOM structures assert that a death happened:
//1 DEAT Y
//1 DEAT
//2 DATE 2 OCT 1937
//1 DEAT
//2 PLAC Cove, Cache, Utah


//Using this convention, as opposed to the just the presence of the tag, protects GEDCOM processors
//which removes (prunes) lines which have neither a value nor any subordinate line. It also allows a
//note or source to be attached to an event context without implying that the event occurred.
//It is not proper GEDCOM form to use a N(o) value with an event tag to infer that it did not happen.
//A convention to handle events which never happened may be defined in the future.

//NSFX tags are provided optionally for systems that cannot operate effectively with less structured
//information. For current future compatibility, all systems must construct their names based on the



//<NAME_PERSONAL> structure. Those using the optional name pieces should assume that few
//systems will process them, and most will not provide the name pieces.
//A <NAME_TYPE> is used to specify the particular variation that this name is. For example; if the
//name type is subordinate to the <NAME_PERSONAL> it could indicate that this name is a name
//taken at immigration or that it could be an ‘also known as’ name (see page 56.)
//Future GEDCOM releases (6.0 or later) will likely apply a very different strategy to resolve this
//problem, possibly using a sophisticated parser and a name-knowledge database.

//The data provided in the <<SOURCE_CITATION>> structure is source-related information specific
//to the data being cited. (See GEDCOM examples starting on page 74.) Systems that do not use a
//(SOURCE_RECORD) must use the non-preferred second SOURce citation structure option. When
//systems that support the zero level source record format encounters a source citation that does not
//contain pointers to source records, then that system needs to create a SOURCE_RECORD format
//and store the source description information found in the non-structured source citation in the title
//area for the new source record.
//The information intended to be placed in the citation structure includes:
// The pointer to the SOURCE_RECORD, which contains a more general description of the source
//used for the fact being cited.
// Information, such as a page number, to help the user find the cited data within the referenced
//source. This is stored in the “.SOUR.PAGE” tag context.
// Actual text from the source that was used in making assertions, for example a date phrase as
//actually recorded in the source, or significant notes written by the recorder, or an applicable
//sentence from a letter. This is stored in the “.SOUR.DATA.TEXT” tag context.
//Data that allows an assessment of the relative value of one source over another for making the
//recorded assertions (primary or secondary source, etc.). Data needed for this assessment is data
//that would help determine how much time from the date of the asserted fact and when the source
//was actually recorded, what type of event was cited, and what type of role did this person have in
//the cited source.
//- Date when the entry was recorded in source document is stored in the
//".SOUR.DATA.DATE" tag context.
//- The type of event that initiated the recording is stored in the “SOUR.EVEN” tag context. The
//value used is the event code taken from the table of choices shown in the
//EVENT_TYPE_CITED_FROM primitive on page 49
//- The role of this person in the event is stored in the ".SOUR.EVEN.ROLE" context.

//Library, should show a call number of the source at that repository. The call number of that source
//should be recorded using a subordinate CALN tag. Systems which do not use repository name and

//of the REPOsitory source citation structure.
