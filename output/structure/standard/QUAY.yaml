standard tag: 'QUAY'

specification:
  - An assessment of the certainty of the evidence to support the conclusion drawn from evidence.
  - [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ]
    The QUAY tag's value conveys the submitter's quantitative evaluation of the credibility of a piece of information, based upon its supporting evidence. Some systems use this feature to rank multiple conflicting opinions for display of most likely information first. It is not intended to eliminate the receiver's need to evaluate the evidence for themselves.
  - 0 = Unreliable evidence or estimated data
    1 = Questionable reliability of evidence (interviews, census, oral genealogies, or potential for bias for example, an autobiography)
    2 = Secondary evidence, data officially recorded sometime after event
    3 = Direct and primary evidence used, or by dominance of the evidence
