standard tag: 'NAME'

specification:
  - A word or combination of words used to help identify an individual, title, or other item. More than one NAME line should be used for people who were known by multiple names.
  - [
    <NAME_TEXT> |
    /<NAME_TEXT>/ |
    <NAME_TEXT> /<NAME_TEXT>/ |
    /<NAME_TEXT>/ <NAME_TEXT> |
    <NAME_TEXT> /<NAME_TEXT>/ <NAME_TEXT>
    ]
    The surname of an individual, if known, is enclosed between two slash (/) characters. The order of the name parts should be the order that the person would, by custom of their culture, have used when giving it to a recorder. Early versions of Personal Ancestral File (r) and other products did not use the trailing slash when the surname was the last element of the name. If part of name is illegible, that part is indicated by an ellipsis (...). Capitalize the name of a person or place in the conventional
    manner- capitalize the first letter of each part and lowercase the other letters, unless conventional usage is otherwise. For example: McMurray.
  - Examples:
    William Lee (given name only or surname not known)
    /Parry/ (surname only) William Lee /Parry/
    William Lee /Mac Parry/ (both parts (Mac and Parry) are surname parts William /Lee/ Parry (surname imbedded in the name string)
    William Lee /Pa.../
