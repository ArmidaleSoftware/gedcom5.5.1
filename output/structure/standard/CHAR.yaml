standard tag: 'CHAR'

specification:
  - An indicator of the character set used in writing this automated information.
  - [ ANSEL |UTF-8 | UNICODE | ASCII ]
    A code value that represents the character set to be used to interpret this data. Currently, the preferred character set is ANSEL, which includes ASCII as a subset. UNICODE is not widely supported by most operating systems; therefore, GEDCOM produced using the UNICODE character set will be limited in its interchangeability for a while but should eventually provide the international flexibility that is desired. See Chapter 3, starting on page 77.
  - Note:The IBMPC character set is not allowed. This character set cannot be interpreted properly without knowing which code page the sender was using.
