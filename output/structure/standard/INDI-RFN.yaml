specification:
  - A permanent number assigned to a record that uniquely identifies it within a known file.

    <REGISTERED_RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER>:<RECORD_IDENTIFIER>
    "The record number that uniquely identifies this record within a registered network resource. The number will be usable as a cross-reference pointer. The use of the colon (:) is reserved to indicate the separation of the \"registered resource identifier\" (which precedes the colon) and the unique \"record identifier\" within that resource (which follows the colon). If the colon is used, implementations that check pointers should not expect to find a matching cross-reference identifier in the transmission but would find it in the indicated database within a network. Making resource files available to a public network is a future implementation."
